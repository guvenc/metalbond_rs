## About MetalBond

MetalBond is a high-performance networking system that implements a distributed route exchange protocol. It enables seamless network integration across different virtual networks by providing:

- VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) based segregation
- Dynamic route exchange between peers
- Lock-less design for high concurrency
- Support for IPv4 and IPv6 routing
- Platform independence for server components

## Project Status

This implementation is a Rust port of the original MetalBond system, with a focus on performance and lock-less design to handle high-volume route exchanges with minimal overhead.
